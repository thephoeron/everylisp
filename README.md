# EVERYLISP

Everylisp is an abstract Common Lisp REPL that interactively compiles and runs code in every Lisp implementation simultaneously, running test suites, automatically handling restarts, profiling and benchmarking, the works&mdash;comparing results, it tries to fix errors first with portable code, then with implementation-dependent code. Treating multi-implementation, multi-platform CI/CD more like cross-implementation delta debugging experiments.

It's an absurd idea, but it might just be a feasible one now.
